# Preassignment for future touchsoft ML course

Technical requirements:

* Python 3.6+

And libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* jupyter notebook

I'd recommend you to use special distribution [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), or if you have a linux environment you use system python (with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you don't want to touch system libraries) 

Task preview is available [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/MaximAntonovich/1b73200a250f0b4e2b0c082a30b90f86)
